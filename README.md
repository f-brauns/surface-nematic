This repository cotains the code for the PNAS article "Patterning of morphogenetic anisotropy fields" by Zihang Wang, M. Cristina Marchetti, and Fridtjof Brauns

Simulations of nematic textures, formulated using the Q-tensor formalism as described in the paper, were performed in Python (using FEniCS) and COMSOL Multiphyisics. 3D renderings of the results were generated using Mathematica.
